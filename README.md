## 🚀 Key Features

Hybrid Trading Engine:
Seamlessly merges a decentralized on-chain order book with Raydium’s automated market maker (AMM) pools to unlock the benefits of both models.

Optimal Price Execution:
Smart order routing intelligently sources liquidity from the order book and Raydium aggregator to secure the most favorable pricing for every trade.

Ultra-Fast Settlement:
Leveraging Solana’s high-performance blockchain, transactions are executed and finalized within seconds, with minimal fees and no intermediaries.

On-Chain, Permissionless Order Book:
A fully decentralized, transparent order book allows users to place limit and market orders without relying on custodians or centralized services.

Liquidity Aggregation:
Maximizes available liquidity by combining native order book depth with Raydium’s extensive pool network for minimal slippage and tighter spreads.

Composable & Modular Architecture:
Designed to be easily integrated into other Solana-based DeFi applications and protocols, enabling permissionless innovation and ecosystem growth.

⚙️ How It Works
Order Placement:
Traders submit limit or market orders directly to the on-chain order book.

Order Matching & Routing:
The smart contract either matches orders internally or intelligently routes them to Raydium’s AMM pools for optimal pricing and liquidity.

Trade Execution:
Orders are executed at the best available market rates with minimal slippage, ensuring fairness and efficiency.

On-Chain Settlement:
All trades are transparently settled on-chain, maintaining the decentralized and trustless nature of the platform.
